On subsequent lines, we can add any amount of additional description (such as the rules section, in this example).\n\n\n\n\nIn isolation, each rule by itself is understandable, but there is ambiguous complexity when we try to describe the feature in terms of \nrules\n. For example, what does it mean to add tax? What happens when we have two products, one of which is less than \u00a310, and another one that is more?\n\n\nTo resolve this, we must have another conversation with our business stakeholders. This will often take the form of actual examples of a customer adding products to the basket. After some back-and-forth, we agree upon a list of behaviour examples.\n\n\nIn \nBDD\n, these are called \nScenarios\n.\n\n\nScenarios\n\n\nAfter conversation with our business stakeholders, we came up with the following:\n\n\nFeature:\n Shopping basket\n\n\n    In order to buy products\n\n\n    As a customer\n\n\n    I need to be able to put interesting products into a basket\n\n\n\n    Rules:\n\n\n    - Tax is 20%\n\n\n    - Delivery for basket under \u00a310 is \u00a33\n\n\n    - Delivery for basket over \u00a310 is \u00a32\n\n\n\n    \nScenario:\n Buying a single product under \u00a310\n\n\n        Given \nthere is a \nself-sealing stem bolt\n, which costs \u00a3\n5\n\n\n        \nWhen \nI add the \nself-sealing stem bolt\n to the basket\n\n\n        \nThen \nI should have \n1\n product in the basket\n\n\n            \nAnd \nthe overall basket price should be \u00a3\n9\n\n\n\n    \nScenario:\n Buying a single product over \u00a310\n\n\n        Given \nthere is \nyamok sauce\n, which costs \u00a3\n15\n\n\n        \nWhen \nI add the \nyamok sauce\n to the basket\n\n\n        \nThen \nI should have \n1\n product in the basket\n\n\n            \nAnd \nthe overall basket price should be \u00a3\n20\n\n\n\n    \nScenario:\n Buying two products over \u00a310\n\n\n        Given \nthere is \nyamok sauce\n, which costs \u00a3\n10\n\n\n            \nAnd \nthere is a \nself-sealing stem bolt\n, which costs \u00a3\n5\n\n\n        \nWhen \nI add the \nyamok sauce\n to the basket\n\n\n            \nAnd \nI add the \nself-sealing stem bolt\n to the basket\n\n\n        \nThen \nI should have \n2\n products in the basket\n\n\n            \nAnd \nthe overall basket price should be \u00a3\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know?\n\n\nScenarios in Feature files should focus on the \nwhat\n, rather than the \nhow\n.\n\n\nEach Scenario should be concise and to the point, so that the reader can quickly grasp the intent of the test without having to read a lot of irrelevant steps.\n\n\n\n\nThe totality of the above represents our business\n shared understanding of our project, written in a structured format. It is based on the clear and constructive conversation we had together with our business stakeholders. This, in essence, is what \nBDD\n is.\n\n\nContexts\n\n\nBehat allows us to automate behaviour checks by comparing the prescribed behaviour against a system\ns actual behavior. Before Behat can do this, we need to teach it how to understand our structured language \n otherwise, how is it meant to understand what we mean by \nthen I should have 2 products in the basket\n?\n\n\nContexts are PHP objects that tell Behat how to test Features. Behat parses the \nPHPDoc annotation\n to map instructions in a Scenario, to methods within Context objects (known as a Step Definition).\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nFeature files describe how a system should behave, and Contexts explain how to test it.\n\n\n\n\nA Context always follows the same basic format:\n\n\n\n?php\n\n\nclass\n \nFeatureContext\n \nimplements\n \n\\Behat\\Behat\\Context\\Context\n\n\n{\n\n    \n/** @Given some context */\n\n    \npublic\n \nfunction\n \nprepareContext\n()\n\n    \n{\n\n        \n// Do something.\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \n/** @When some event */\n\n    \npublic\n \nfunction\n \ndoSomeEvent\n()\n\n    \n{\n\n        \n// Do something.\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \n/** @Then outcome */\n\n    \npublic\n \nfunction\n \ncheckOutcome\n()\n\n    \n{\n\n        \n// Do something.\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \n@Given\n, \n@When\n, and \n@Then\n keywords allow Behat to match a Step to a method.\n\n\nIn the annotation, Behat can capture tokens (words starting with a colon, e.g.\n\n:arg1\n) and pass their value to the method as arguments. Behat also supports optionally matching part of an Step using brackets.\n\n\n\n\nDid you know?\n\n\nTo facilitate more complex matching requirements, Behat supports regular expressions.\n\n\n\n\nAn example of a Step Definition required for our e-commerce website is:\n\n\n\n?php\n\n\n/**\n\n\n * @Given there is a(n) :arg1, which costs \u00a3:arg2\n\n\n */\n\n\npublic\n \nfunction\n \nthereIsAWhichCosts\n(\n$arg1\n,\n \n$arg2\n)\n\n\n{\n\n    \n// Check $arg1 costs $arg2.\n\n    \n// Add $arg1 to shopping basket.\n\n    \n// If something goes wrong, throw an Exception.\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PHPDoc annotation for this method tells Behat that the method should be executed whenever Behat sees a Step that looks like \n... there is a ..., which costs \u00a3...\n. This pattern will match any of the following Steps:\n\n\n\n\nGiven there is a \nself-sealing stem bolt\n, which costs \u00a35\n\n\nGiven there is a \nself-sealing stem bolt\n, which costs \u00a310\n\n\nGiven there is an 'automated assembler', which costs \u00a310\n\n\nGiven there is a bolt, which costs \u00a32\n\n\n\n\nNext steps\n\n\nThis guide has introduced the basics of Behat and \nBDD\n.

In the annotation, Behat can capture tokens (words starting with a colon, e.g. :arg1 ) and pass their value to the method as arguments. Behat also supports optionally matching part of an Step using brackets.   Did you know?  To facilitate more complex matching requirements, Behat supports regular expressions.   An example of a Step Definition required for our e-commerce website is:  ?php  /**   * @Given there is a(n) :arg1, which costs \u00a3:arg2   */  public   function   thereIsAWhichCosts ( $arg1 ,   $arg2 )  { \n     // Check $arg1 costs $arg2. \n     // Add $arg1 to shopping basket. \n     // If something goes wrong, throw an Exception.  }    The PHPDoc annotation for this method tells Behat that the method should be executed whenever Behat sees a Step that looks like  ... there is a ..., which costs \u00a3... . This pattern will match any of the following Steps:   Given there is a  self-sealing stem bolt , which costs \u00a35  Given there is a  self-sealing stem bolt , which costs \u00a310  Given there is an 'automated assembler', which costs \u00a310  Given there is a bolt, which costs \u00a32",

This should be considered an experimental feature for advanced users only. To enable it, tag a scenario with the name of the driver to use (e.g. \n@wpcli\n or \n@wpphp\n).\n\n\n\n\nSelenium\n\n\n\n\nOn a Mac, Selenium is incompatible with the default Apple Java; error messages look like \nUnsupported major.minor version 52.0\n. To fix, install \nOracle Java Platform JDK\n.\n\n\nWith Selenium, some environments may require a \nwebdriver\n; error messages may refer to \nGeckoWebDriver\n or \nChromeWebDriver\n, etc. Good solutions include \nvvo/selenium-standalone\n or \njoomla-projects/selenium-server-standalone\n.\n\n\n\n\nSupported platforms\n\n\n\n\nWordHat supports MacOS, most flavours of Linux, and Windows. We use \nTravis-CI\n and \nAppveyor\n to test on Ubuntu and Windows, respectively, and require modern versions of PHP.\n\n\n\n\nVirtual machines (Vagrant)\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using a Vagrant-powered virtual machine to run Behat via the \nWP-CLI driver\n, you will need to \nvagrant ssh\n into the box once.
